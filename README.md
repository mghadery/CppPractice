# CppPractice
This repository contains my journey of learning C++. It started with reading the book: C++ Crash Course: A Fast-Paced Introduction. It is going to contain my practice and exercices while reading the book and continue with more complex projects for embedded systems.

## Overview
- The repository will contain code snippets, exercises, and mini-projects as I progress through C++ learning materials.
- It contains a folder named CppPractice dedicated to book practice. For each book part a folder is created.

## Goals
- Gain hands-on experience with modern C++.
- Experience with Qt development.
- Experience with embedded Linux development.

## Current Status
- Started with **basic syntax** and simple programs but some more advanced features like templates, constexpr and auto variables were practiced shortly.
